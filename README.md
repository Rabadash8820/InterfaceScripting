# Interface Scripting

The Unity3D project in this repo was built according to the following instructions:


- Create a UGUI interface that supports a list and a way to cycle through the list items.
- The list should reference some models, they can be custom models or just unity primitives like sphere, cube etc.
- When a model is selected, the user should be able to drag on their model, then rotate, enlarge and pan it, use mouse only(no button)
- Store the unique data after the model is selected and move to new position. When the model is selected again, display that data, meaning the model display or stay at last position location
- Create a login and log out screen using any solution.
- Save the model rotation location by using  any solution.
- Log the user actions.
- Write the action log to a connected database (option, such as AWS database) or a text file.
- Send us the Code and EXE file
